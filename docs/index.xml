      <description>Project introduction In this project we are looking for an answer to the question: &amp;ldquo;What makes artists successful?&amp;quot;. In order to find the answer we collect a wide range of data regarding artists&amp;rsquo; interactions, their artistic creations and popularity of their work.
We will first introduce you to the dataset we have created, then we will attempt to predict an artists&amp;rsquo; success directly. Finally, we get insight into the nature of collaborations between artists, as we find that number of partnerships strongly correlates with artists&amp;rsquo; popularity.</description>
